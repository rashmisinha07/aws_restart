## Working with Amazon EBS
### overview

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a scalable, high-performance block-storage service that is designed for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). In this lab, I learn how to create an EBS volume and perform operations on it, such as attaching it to an instance, creating a file system, and taking a snapshot backup.
