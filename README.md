# AWS Projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services in cloud computing and it is chosen by my clients based on flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

In my GitHub repository I will be demonstrating some projects that I have successfully implemented in the production environment and to excel my experience related working with AWS products and services to be future references for me as a  Cloud Engineers. I will put my projects with a view to brevity and clarity to show my skills towards that project.
