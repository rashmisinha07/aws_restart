# Install and Configure the AWS CLI
I installed and configured the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI.
I established a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance.
I configured the installation with an access key that can connect to an AWS account. Finally, I used the AWS CLI to interact with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
