# Creating a Website on S3
## Overview
I practice using AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands from an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to:
 * Create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
 * Create a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user that has full access to the Amazon S3 service.
 * Upload files to Amazon S3 to host a simple website for the Caf√© & Bakery.
 * Create a batch file that can be used to update the static website when you change any of the website files locally.

   Clients will be able to access the website I have deployed to Amazon S3. The website URL is similar to this example: 
   http://.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com. I can create and access the bucket through the AWS Management Console or 
    the AWS CLI.

   # Use SSH to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
    I loged in to an existing EC2 instance.
    I am using window.
* **Step 1:** Download the ppk and save the **labsuser.ppk** file.
* **Step 2:** Copy and paste the PublicIP into a text editor
* **Step 3:** Download PuTTY to use an SSH utility to connect to the EC2 instance
* **Step 4:** Open putty.exe.
* **Step 5:** Configure the PuTTY timeout to keep the PuTTY session open for a longer period of time:
                Choose Connection.
                For Seconds between keepalives, enter `30`
* **Step 6:** Configure the PuTTY session:
              Choose Session.
              For the Host Name (or IP address), enter the PublicIP address that I copied from the previous steps.
               In PuTTY in the Connection list, choose SSH 
               Choose Auth
                Choose Browse.
                Browse to and select the labuser.ppk file that I downloaded.
                To choose the file, choose Open.
* **Step 7:** In the PuTTY Security Alert window, choose Accept to trust and connect to the host.
* **Step 8:** When prompted with login as, enter `ec2-user` and press Enter.

# Configure the AWS CLI

Unlike some other Linux distributions that are available through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Linux instances already have the AWS CLI pre-installed on them.
* **Step 9:** In the SSH session terminal window, run the configure command to update the AWS CLI software with credentials.

                           aws configure

 * **Step 10:** At the prompt, configure the following:
               * AWS Secret Access Key: Copy and paste the SecretKey value into the terminal window.
               * Default region name: Enter us-west-2
               * Default output format: Enter json

   # Create an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI

   The s3api command creates a new S3 bucket with the AWS credentials in this lab. By default, the S3 bucket is created in 
    the us-east-1 Region.
   When I create a new S3 bucket, the bucket must have a unique name, such as the combination of my first initial, last 
    name, and three random numbers. For example, if a user's name is Terry Whitlock, a bucket name could be `twhitlock256`

  * **Step 11:** To create a bucket in Amazon S3, I use the aws s3api create-bucket command. When I use this command to 
                 create an S3 bucket, you also include the following:

    * Specify `--region us-west-2`
    * Add `--create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2` to the end of the command.
      
    The following is an example of the command to create a new S3 bucket. I can use rashmi07 as my bucket name.

           aws s3api create-bucket --bucket rashmi07 --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2


If the command is successful, I will get a JSON-formatted response with a Location name-value pair, where the value reflects the bucket name. The following is an example:

   # Create a new IAM user that has full access to Amazon S3
   The AWS CLI command: `aws iam create-user` creates a new IAM user for my AWS account. The option `--user-name` is used to create the name of the user and must be unique within the account. 

   * **Step 12:** Using the AWS CLI, create a new IAM user with the command `aws iam create-user` and username `awsS3user`:

          aws iam create-user --user-name awsS3user

   * **Step 13:**  Create a login profile for the new user by using the following command:

           aws iam create-login-profile --user-name awsS3user --password Training123!

   * **Step 14:** Copy the AWS account number:
     *  In the AWS Management Console, choose the account voclabs/user... drop down menu located at the top right of the screen.
     *  Copy the 12 digit Account ID number.
     *  In the current drop down menu, choose Sign Out.

* **Step 15:** Log in to the AWS Management Console as the new awsS3user user:
    * In the browser tab where you just signed out of the AWS Management Console, choose Log back in or Sign in to the Console.
    * In the sign-in screen, choose the radio button IAM user.
    * In the text field, paste or enter the account ID with no dashes.
    * Choose Next

 * A new login screen with Sign in as IAM user field will show. The account ID will be filled in from the previous screen.
    * For **IAM user name**, enter `awsS3user`
    * For **Password**, enter `Training123!`
    * Choose **Sign In**

* **Step 16:** On the AWS Management Console, in the Search box, enter S3 and choose S3. This option takes me to the Amazon S3 console page.
  **Note**: The bucket that I created might not be visible. Refresh the Amazon S3 console page to see if it appears. The **awsS3user** user does not have Amazon S3 access to the bucket that you created, so you might see an error for **Access** to this bucket.

  * **Step 17:** In the terminal window, to find the AWS managed policy that grants full access to Amazon S3, run the following command:
 
           aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?contains(PolicyName,'S3')]"

    ![image](https://github.com/rashmisinha07/aws_restart/assets/62481476/16b99e53-34a9-418f-9dad-856b25ef0d63)

    The result displays policies that have a PolicyName attribute containing the term S3. Locate the policy that grants full access to Amazon S3. I use this policy in the next step.

  * **Step 18:**  To grant the awsS3user user full access to the S3 bucket, replace <policyYouFound> in following command with the appropriate PolicyName from the results, and run the adjusted command:
 
         
         aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess --user-name awsS3user
 

* **Step 19:** Return to the AWS Management Console, and refresh the browser tab.

  If you implemented the correct policy, the **Access** portion of the bucket now has **Objects can be public**.
