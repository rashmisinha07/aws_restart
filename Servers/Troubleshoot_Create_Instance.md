# Troubleshooting the Creation of an EC2 Instance
## Activity overview

I  used the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

When I create the instance, I will reference a user data script to configure the instance to have an Apache web server, a MariaDB relational database (which is a fork of the MySQL relational database), and PHP running on the instance. Together, these software packages installed on a single machine are often referred to as a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP). Using a LAMP stack is a common way to create a website with a database backend on a single machine.

The same user data file will deploy website files and run database configuration scripts on the instance. The result will be an instance that hosts the Caf√© Web Application. 

The following diagram shows the architecture that you will create in this activity.
