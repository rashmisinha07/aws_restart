This lab provides  a basic overview of launching, resizing, managing, and monitoring an Amazon EC2 instance.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows me to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides me with complete control of my computing resources and lets I run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing me to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as my computing requirements change.

Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing me to pay only for capacity that I actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.



## Accessing the AWS Management Console
* **Step 1:** At the upper-right corner of these instructions, choose  **Start Lab**

**Troubleshooting tip**: If you get an **Access Denied** error, close the error box, and choose  Start Lab again.

The lab status can be interpreted as follows:

   * A red circle next to **AWS** :red_circle:  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates the lab has not been started.

   * A yellow circle next to **AWS** :yellow_circle:  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates the lab is starting.

   * A green circle next to **AWS** :green_circle:  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates the lab is ready.

Wait for the lab to be ready before proceeding.

At the top of these instructions, choose the green circle next to **AWS** :green_circle:

This option opens the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system automatically sign you in.

**Tip:** If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon at the top of your browser will indicate that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon, and choose Allow pop-ups.

Arrange the AWS Management Console tab so that it displays along side these instructions. Ideally, you should be able to see both browser tabs at the same time so that you can follow the lab steps.
